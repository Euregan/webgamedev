# üè≠ General-Purpose Web Frameworks

You can build your main backend API using web frameworks or libraries that are not specifically designed for games. But you might need additional processes or services to handle game-specific logic, for instance to run a 3D simulation of a scene for client validation, or a stateful websocket server.

There are plenty of backend languages and frameworks available, such as Rails for Ruby or Django for Python, but I will focus on Node.js options since we are already working with JavaScript or TypeScript.

You may use simple HTTP endpoints, REST, GraphQL, or tRPC.

## Barebones web server libraries

<ProjectList
  projects={[
    { name: 'Express' },
    { name: 'Fastify', url: 'https://www.fastify.io/' },
    { name: 'Koaport' },
  ]}
/>

## Backend Frameworks

<ProjectList projects={[{ name: 'Next' }, { name: 'Nest' }]} />

Include Deno, Bun options

## Authentication

<ProjectList projects={[{ name: 'Next Auth' }, { name: 'Passport' }]} />

## GraphQL

<ProjectList projects={[graphql.apolloServer]} />

## tRPC

[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is a new library that allows you to call remote functions (similarly to gRPC) from the browser via React Query, in a fully-typed experience.

<ProjectList projects={[trpc]} />
